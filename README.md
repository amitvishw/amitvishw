## ✨ My Dev Story So Far

I started my career at **Snapwiz Inc.**, diving into full-stack development — working on everything from large-scale data pipelines to browser-based image processing tools.

Later, I joined **Safe Security**, where I worked on **mirco service architectures**, **low-latency data streams**, and **Generative AI**. I’ve built AI assistants, smart automation agents, and data systems powering on-demand analytics and trends.

Across both roles, I’ve loved solving complex problems, delivering reliable features, and working with amazing people.

## 🚶‍♂️ Beyond the Code

When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me:

- 🃏 Playing unhealthy amount of **Gwent** in **The Witcher 3**
- ♟️ Blundering my way to **1250+ ELO** on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com)
- 📸 Capturing photographs.
